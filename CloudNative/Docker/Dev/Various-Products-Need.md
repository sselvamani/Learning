Various Products for Various Needs

- In a production environment that runs containers hosting critical applications, you would rather have your favorite admins install Docker Enterprise.
However, on your development machine or a continuous integration build machine, you can use the free Docker Engine Community or Docker Desktop depending 
on your machine type.

In short:

| Use 	| Product 	|
|-	|-	|
| Developer machine 	| Docker Engine Community <br>or<br>Docker Desktop 	|
| Small server, small expectations 	| Docker Engine Community 	|
| Serious stuff/Critical applications 	| Docker Engine Enterprise <br>or Kubernetes 	|


## Hello World Test 

Whatever the edition you install, you can check your installation by running the following command in a command-line (your terminal on Linux, 
or PowerShell on Windows):

```
docker run hello-world

```
