# ReplicationController 

Note: A Deployment that configures a ReplicaSet is now the recommended way to set up replication.

- A ReplicationController ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. 
In other words, a ReplicationController makes sure that a pod or a homogeneous set of pods is always up and available.

# How a ReplicationController Works?

If there are too many pods, the ReplicationController terminates the extra pods. If there are too few, the ReplicationController starts more pods.
Unlike manually created pods, the pods maintained by a ReplicationController are automatically replaced if they fail, are deleted, or are terminated. 
For example, your pods are re-created on a node after disruptive maintenance such as a kernel upgrade. For this reason, you should use a ReplicationController even if your application 
requires only a single pod. A ReplicationController is similar to a process supervisor, but instead of supervising individual processes on a single node, the ReplicationController 
supervises multiple pods across multiple nodes.

ReplicationController is often abbreviated to “rc” in discussion, and as a shortcut in kubectl commands. A simple case is to create one ReplicationController 
object to reliably run one instance of a Pod indefinitely. A more complex use case is to run several identical replicas of a replicated service, such as web servers.

# ReplicationController manifest file syntax:
```

## ---------------------------------
## ReplicationController YAML syntax
## ---------------------------------

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  <replicationcontrollerMetadata>
spec:
  <replicationcontrollerSpec>

```


- replicationcontrollerMetadata attributes:

    - annotations: Key value map stored with a resource for arbitrary metadata.
    - clusterName: The name of the cluster which the object belongs to.
    - creationTimestamp: Timestamp representing the server time when this object was created.
    - deletionGracePeriodSeconds: Seconds allowed for gracefully terminate before forcefully removed from the system.
    - deletionTimestamp: RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. Is not directly settable by a client.
    - finalizers: Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry.
    - generateName: Optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.
    - generation: A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
    - initializers: An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at object creation time.
    - labels: Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.
    - name: Name must be unique within a namespace.
    - namespace: Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique, default namespace is default.
    - ownerReferences: List of objects depended by this object.
    - resourceVersion: An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object used to determine when objects have changed.
    - selfLink: SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.
    - uid: UID is the unique in time and space value for this object
    
- replicationcontrollerSpec attributes:

   - minReadySeconds: Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0
   - replicas: Replicas is the number of desired replicas. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and unspecified. Defaults to 1.
   - selector: Selector is a label query over pods that should match the Replicas count. If Selector is empty, it is defaulted to the labels present on the Pod template. Label keys and values that must match in order to be controlled by this replication controller, if empty defaulted to labels on Pod template.
   - template: Template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected.

Faq : 1. replicationcontrollerMetadata attributes : deletionGracePeriodSeconds 
Is it same as parameter at pod specification by name "terminationGracePeriodSeconds" ? 
{: .label .label-red }

yes ! as per my personal knowledge ! 

graceful delete option for pods
on the Kubelet.  When a pod is deleted on the API server, a
grace period is calculated that is based on the
Pod.Spec.TerminationGracePeriodInSeconds, the user's provided grace
period, or a default.  The grace period can only shrink once set.
The value provided by the user (or the default) is set onto metadata
as DeletionGracePeriod.

When the Kubelet sees a pod with DeletionTimestamp set, it uses the
value of ObjectMeta.GracePeriodSeconds as the grace period
sent to Docker.  When updating status, if the pod has DeletionTimestamp
set and all containers are terminated, the Kubelet will update the
status one last time and then invoke Delete(pod, grace: 0) to
clean up the pod immediately.


# 

- Docker containers can be terminated any time, due to an auto-scaling policy, pod or deployment deletion or while rolling out an update. In most of such cases, you will probably want to graceful shutdown your application running inside the container.

- In our case, for example, we do want to wait until all current requests (or jobs processing) have completed, but the actual reasons to graceful shutdown an application may be many, including releasing resources, distributed locks or opened connections.

# How it works

- When a pod should be terminated:

   - A SIGTERM signal is sent to the main process (PID 1) in each container, and a “grace period” countdown starts (defaults to 30 seconds - see below to change it).
   - Upon the receival of the SIGTERM, each container should start a graceful shutdown of the running application and exit.
   - If a container doesn’t terminate within the grace period, a SIGKILL signal will be sent and the container violently terminated.
   
   
   refer: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#termination-of-pods
   
# A common pitfall while handling the SIGTERM

Let’s say your Dockerfile ends with a CMD in the shell form:

```
CMD myapp

```

- the shell form runs the command with /bin/sh -c myapp, so the process that will get the SIGTERM is actually /bin/sh and not its child myapp. Depending on the actual shell you’re running, it could or could not pass the signal to its children.

- For example, the shell shipped by default with Alpine Linux does not pass signals to children, while Bash does it. If your shell doesn’t pass signals to children, you’ve a couple of options to ensure the signal will be correctly delivered to the app.

# Option #1: run the CMD in the exec form

You can obviously use the CMD in the exec form. This will run myapp instead of /bin/sh -c myapp, but will not allow you to pass environment variables as arguments.

```

CMD [ "myapp" ]

```

Option #2: run the command with Bash

You can ensure your container includes Bash and run your command through it, in order to support environment variables passed as arguments.

```
CMD [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "myapp --arg=$ENV_VAR" ]

```
# How to change the grace period


The default grace period is 30 seconds. As any default, it could fit or couldn’t fit on your specific use cases. There are two way to change it:

    - In the deployment .yaml file
    - On the command line, when you run kubectl delete
    
    
# Deployment

You can customize the grace period setting terminationGracePeriodSeconds at the pod spec level. For example, the following .yaml shows a simple deployment config with a 60 seconds termination grace period.    

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: test
spec:
    replicas: 1
    template:
        spec:
            containers:
              - name: test
                image: ...
            terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60

```
# Command line

You can also change the default grace period when you manually delete a resource with kubectl delete command, adding the parameter --grace-period=SECONDS. For example:

```
kubectl delete deployment test --grace-period=60

```
Alternatives

There’re some circumstances where a SIGTERM violently kill the application, vanishing all your efforts to gracefully shutdown it. Nginx, for example, quickly exit on SIGTERM, while you should run /usr/sbin/nginx -s quit to gracefully terminate it.

In such cases, you can use the preStop hook. According to the Kubernetes doc, PreStop works as follow:


```

This hook is called immediately before a container is terminated. No parameters are passed to the handler. This event handler is blocking, and must complete before the call to delete the container is sent to the Docker daemon. The SIGTERM notification sent by Docker is also still sent. A more complete description of termination behavior can be found in Termination of Pods.



```

The preStop hook is configured at container level and allows you to run a custom command before the SIGTERM will be sent (please note that the termination grace period countdown actually starts before invoking the preStop hook and not once the SIGTERM signal will be sent).

The following example, taken from the Kubernetes doc, shows how to configure a preStop command.

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        lifecycle:
          preStop:
            exec:
              # SIGTERM triggers a quick exit; gracefully terminate instead
              command: ["/usr/sbin/nginx","-s","quit"]


```

Faq 2 . I could not follow usecase for finalizers and initializers.( If possible, please share relevant links) 
{: .label .label-red }
refer :- https://github.com/sangam14/k8s-initializer 

FAQ 3 : replicationcontrollerSpec attributes: minReadySeconds This is for pod level
we have similar one for container level also pod->spec->container->readinessProbe->initialDelaySeconds
So if readiness probe started passing for all containers of pod, then also, then pod will not move to available state, unless and until minReadySeconds is passed? This  minReadySeconds duration starts after all containers become ready? What is the usecase? 
{: .label .label-red }

initialDelaySeconds: Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness or readiness probes are initiated.
So initialDelaySeconds comes before minReadySeconds.
Lets say, container in the pod has started at t seconds. Readiness probe will be initiated at t+initialDelaySeconds seconds. Assume Pod become ready at t1 seconds(t1 > t+initialDelaySeconds). So this pod will be available after t1+minReadySeconds seconds.

refer :- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#min-ready-seconds

- minReadySeconds:
   - the bootup time of your application, Kubernetes waits specific time til the next pod creation.
   - Kubernetes assume that your application is available once the pod created by default.
   -  If you leave this field empty, the service may be unavailable after the update process cause all the application pods are not ready yet
   - you’ll use the RollingUpdate strategy, but you need to slow down the update process a little, so you can see that the update is indeed performed in a 
     rolling fashion. You can do that by setting the minReadySeconds attribute on the Deployment. For now, set it to 10 seconds with the kubectl patch command.
   
   did you tried ?
   ```
   
   $ kubectl patch deployment <name> -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 10}}'
   
   ```
